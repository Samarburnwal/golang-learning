🐹 Go (Golang) Learning Journey

Welcome to my Golang Learning Repository!
This repository contains my notes, practice programs, and mini-projects as I learn the Go programming language.

📘 About Go

Go (or Golang) is an open-source programming language developed by Google.
It’s known for its simplicity, speed, and built-in support for concurrency — making it ideal for scalable web servers, distributed systems, and backend applications.

🚀 Learning Goals

Understand Go’s syntax and basic concepts

Learn about data types, functions, and packages

Explore concurrency using goroutines and channels

Build small CLI and web-based projects

Get familiar with Go modules and dependency management

Learn how to write clean, idiomatic Go code
